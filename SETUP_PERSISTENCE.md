The app now supports Upstash Redis for free, persistent storage of the community feed.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

2. Sign up for a free account (GitHub login available)
3. No credit card required!

### 2. Create Redis Database
1. Click "Create Database"
2. Name: `defeatai-feed` (or any name)
3. Type: Regional
4. Region: Choose closest to your users
5. Click "Create"

### 3. Get Credentials
1. In your database dashboard, go to "REST API" section
2. Copy these values:
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

### 4. Add to Vercel
1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your `defeatai` project

4. Add both variables:

## That's it! ðŸŽ‰

Your feed is now persistent and will survive:
- Server restarts
- New deployments
- Multiple instances

## Free Tier Limits
- 10,000 commands per day (more than enough!)
- 256MB storage
- No credit card required

## Local Development
The app works without Redis in development - it just won't persist data.
